## Rules (what players see) · v0.5 beta "Banana for Scale"
Five rounds a day, 20 seconds each. Every round asks one question in the same shape:
"How many bananas long is a school bus?" Players type a number (1200, 1,200 and 1.2k all work).

## Scoring
How far off a guess is gets measured in multiples, the same in both directions.
Within 10% of the answer = 100. 2x off ≈ 73, 5x off ≈ 31, 10x off or more = 0. Max 500 a day.
Share marks: 🍌 90+, 🟨 60+, 🟫 30+, ⬜ under 30.

## Daily schedule
Items live in `tools/scale_items.txt` (`name | plural | article | long/tall/across | cm | u`, where `u` means it can be the counting unit).
Edit sizes there, then run `python3 tools/make_scale.py` to rebuild `data/items.json` and `data/dailies.json` (365 days from 2026-11-03).
Each day mixes small to huge answers, and the thing being measured doesn't repeat within 10 days.

## Going live (about 15 minutes, Netlify only)

No database account and no sign-in providers. Netlify hosts the game, runs the server functions, and stores everything in Netlify Blobs (built in). Players don't sign in; their scores, streaks and badges live in their browser.

1. **Put the folder on GitHub** (e.g. `ohmyitsdoug/matryo`). Deploy from Git so Netlify installs `@netlify/blobs` for the functions; a drag-and-drop deploy doesn't install dependencies.
2. **Netlify → Add new site → Import from Git** → pick the repo. Build command: leave empty. Publish directory: `.` (netlify.toml already says this).
3. **Site configuration → Environment variables** → add `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (8+ characters; this unlocks `/admin.html`). Optional: `AUTO_PLAYERS` (default 5), `REVIEW_PLAYERS` (default 2), `BLOCKED_WORDS` (comma list of words never to add).
4. **Deploys → Trigger deploy** so the functions see the variable.
5. **Domain management → Add a domain** → `matryo.io`, then follow Netlify's DNS steps at your registrar. HTTPS turns on by itself.
6. **Check it:** play a daily, open `matryo.io/admin.html`, enter the password. Today's visitors and the finished round should show (daily stats refresh hourly and every time you open the page). Netlify → Functions shows `words-daily` (daily) and `stats-hourly` (hourly) as scheduled.

## Accepting new words (no AI) · used by v0.4, not by v0.5

There is no AI anywhere in the game or its server jobs. New words come from players and from you.

When a player types a word the game doesn't know, `log` records it once per player per day (an anonymous random device id, never a name), together with what they typed it after. Once a day `words-daily` looks at yesterday (UTC) and counts different players per word:
1. `AUTO_PLAYERS` (5) or more players → added automatically (`auto`) and live on the next visit.
2. `REVIEW_PLAYERS` (2) or more → queued for you (`review`).
3. Size: about one size (1.5×) smaller than the median thing players typed it after. If players disagree a lot about where it goes (more than 3 sizes apart), it waits for review even with 5+ players.
4. Skipped: words already known or rejected, anything in `BLOCKED_WORDS`, and anything that isn't plain letters.

Open `/admin.html` (with your ADMIN_PASSWORD) to see stats and:
- **Add a word by hand:** a size in mm/cm/m/km, or "same size as" a known word, plus an optional "kind of" word (Surgeon → Doctor).
- **Needs a decision:** approve (with a size you can change) or reject.
- **Auto-approved:** fix the size or undo.
- **Most-typed unknown words:** "Add…" fills the form with a suggested size, or ignore it.

Words you approve or add load into the game on the next visit, no redeploy needed.

## Editing the starting word list

1. Change a size in `tools/sizes/*.txt` (format `size_cm: word word two_word`; later files win, `sizes_z.txt` is for fixes), add other meanings in `senses.txt` (wing: 5000), or add a specific kind in `specific_extra.tsv` (souvenir_cup → cup). The review sheet is `review/snug-words-review.csv`.
2. `cd tools && FREQ=path/to/en_full.txt python3 build_words.py` (frequency list from github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords, optional)
3. `python3 make_dailies.py 2026-11-01 365` to rebuild the schedule (pick your real launch date).
